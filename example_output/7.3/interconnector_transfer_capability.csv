NNSW-SQ,950,950,950,1450,1450,1450,QNI forward direction maximum transfer capacity of 950 MW (design limit with QNI minor).,Thermal capacity of Sapphire-Armidale 330 kV line for an outage of Dumaresq-Armidale 330 kV line. This assumes no Sapphire wind and/or Tilbuster solar generation.,These transfer limits include the completion of the QNI minor project. QNI minor is currently undergoing inter-network testing to release the designed maximum capacity. QLD to NSW transfer limit influenced by generation output from Sapphire Wind Farm and Tilbuster Solar Farm.

SNSW-CSA,150,150,150,150,150,150,Project EnergyConnect Stage 1 design limit.,Project EnergyConnect Stage 1 design limit.,WNV - CSA and SNSW - CSA combined maximum transfer limit is 750 MW in forward direction (import into SA) and 700 MW in reverse direction (export from SA). This transfer limit will increase with full capacity release of Project EnergyConnect (Stage 2 completion). Additional transfer capacity is provided in a table below titled 'Notional transfer capability uplift between the sub-regions for committed and anticipated projects'.
WNV-SNSW,870,1000,1000,400,400,400,Transient stability for a fault on a Hazelwood-South 500 circuit or volage stability in Southern New South Wales for loss of largest load in Victoria.,"Voltage stability in SNSW for loss of the largest generator in Victoria. Prior to HumeLink service, Snowy 2.0 generation or pump load is limited by a transient stability limit.","The forward direction transfer limits include the completion of the VNI minor project.  For peak demand limit in reverse direction - Victoria system integrity protection scheme (SIPS) with 250 MW battery storage in western side of Melbourne raises the thermal capacity in the reverse direction of Victoria-New South Wales interconnector. SSNW to WNV transfer limit during peak periods reduces to 250 MW on conclusion of the VNI SIPS agreement 31 March 2032. For all reverse direction transfer limits - The limit of 660 MW of Snowy 2.0 generation or pumping load represents with Snowy 2.0 connection to the existing network and prior to HumeLink in service. With HumeLink in service, up to 2200 MW of Snowy 2.0 generation or pumping load is made available in modelling.Access of Snowy 2.0 generation to Victoria is subject to NSW to VIC interconnetor transfer limit."
