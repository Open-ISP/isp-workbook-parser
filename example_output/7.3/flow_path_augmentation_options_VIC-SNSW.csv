WNV-SNSW,West of VNI 330 kV path,"Increase thermal capacity and, voltage and stability limit of VIC-NSW interconnector. Provide route diversity of existing VNI 330 kV corridor",VIC-SNSW Option 1 - VNI West,"South West NSW REZ (N5 Option 1) Stage 1: • Upgrade Dinawan - Gugaa double-circuit line from 330 kV to 500 kV operation (lines built at 500 kV as part of Project EnergyConnect). • Establish Dinawan 500 kV switchyard with two 500/330 kV 1500 MVA transformers. • 500 kV line shunt reactors at both ends of the 500 kV double circuits Dinawan – Gugaa. • Bring forward the line shunt reactors for the Dinawan – Tragowel 500 kV double circuit for voltage support at Dinawan. • Terminate Lower Tumut - Wagga 330 kV single-circuit overhead line (line TL51) at Gugga 330 kV. • Build 330 kV double-circuit overhead line between Gugga and Wagga, using the Line TL51 easement. Victoria – New South Wales (Bulgana – Kerang – Dinawan) Stage 2: • A new 500 kV double-circuit overhead line from near Bulgana to Tragowel (near Kerang) to locality of Dinawan, including series compensation on the line near Tragowel. • Establish new Tragowel Terminal Station with two 500/220 kV 1000 MVA transformers. • 220 kV connections from the new Tragowel Terminal Station to the existing 220 kV lines near Kerang. • Eildon – Thomastown and Rowville - Thomastown 220 kV lines are to be cut into at South Morang creating normally operating direct connection between Eildon 220 kV and Rowville 220 kV, in place of previously proposed modular power flow controllers, to prevent overloading on the 220 kV lines between Dederang and Thomastown. South Morang - Thomastown sections of lines are to be bridged together with existing South Morang-Thomastown lines increasing the capacity of those lines. • 500 kV line shunt reactors at both ends of the two following 500 kV circuits:   (i) near Bulgana – Tragowel  (ii) Tragowel – Dinawan at Tragowel • Two new 500 kV bays and line exits with a total of two 500 kV line shunt reactors at the Terminal Station near Bulgana. • Up to +/- 400 MVAr dynamic reactive compensation at the new 220 kV Tragowel Terminal Station. • Series compensation capacitors on both of the 500 kV circuits between Tragowel and near Bulgana, to reduce impedance on the new 500 kV network and thereby improve network load sharing with, and manage network loading on, the existing 330 kV Victoria – New South Wales Interconnector and the existing 220 kV western Victoria network between Bendigo and Kerang.","Victorian Western Renewables Link, HumeLink, Project EnergyConnect",WNV to SNSW,1890,1670,7600,Transgrid and AEMO (Victorian Planning),Class 4(-30% to +50%),491,Short: (5 years),V1: 1580 WV1:200 N5: 350,V1: 1580 WV1:200 N5: 350
