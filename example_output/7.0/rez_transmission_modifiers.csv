On 14 October 2022, by Ministerial Order, the Victorian Government has directed AEMO Victorian Planner to enter into a contract with AusNet services to supply the Mortlake Turn in Project and the network augmentation project. The turn-in project, when combined with Cressy Terminal Station (constructed as part of the Golden Plains Wind Farm committed generation project), is expected to allow up to 1500 MW of additional generation output under optimal network conditions and, on average, 1100 MW of additional generation output during peak summer periods following its commissioning.
